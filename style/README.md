## Style Shifts

Robustness and adaptability of motion forecasting models under style shifts

### Requirements

```
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip3 install torch==1.9.0+cu111 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
```


### Dataset

Synthetic data (`v4`) generated by ORCA can be downloaded at `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OQfZ1Y8XkFhZY8NE_TsSiDwwcvjCIECa/view?usp=sharingare`, and need to be saved in `/datasets/`. 


### Pre-Training

Train Baseline or our modular architecture with Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) or Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM).
```
bash scripts/pretrain.sh
```

Pretrained models on dataset `v4` for all the methods with seed=1,2,3,4,5 are already saved in `/models/v4/pretrain/`.

Evaluate pretrained model.
```
bash scripts/evaluate_pretrain.sh
```
Save all the quantitative results in `results/{dataset_name}/pretrain/summary.csv`.
```
bash scripts/extract_pretrain.sh
```


### Finetune

Finetune Baseline or our modular architecture with Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM) on few samples of a new environment.
```
bash scripts/finetune.sh
```

Finetuned models on dataset `v4` for all the methods with seed=1,2,3,4,5 are already saved in `/models/v4/finetune/`.

Evaluate finetuned model.
```
bash scripts/evaluate_finetune.sh
```

Save all the quantitative results in `results/{dataset_name}/finetune/summary.csv`.
```
bash scripts/extract_finetune.sh
```


### Refinement
Test Time refinement of the predictions on the fly. Instead of simply evaluating the ADE of the predictions, we optimize the latent space to make the prediction's style more similar to the style of the env (using contrastive loss)
```
bash scripts/refine.sh
```

We can either enforce the prediction to follow more the style of the env, or to make the prediction follow another style (with `--wrongstyle true`). The number of steps can be specified with `--ttr` parameter. 


### Basic Results

Results of different methods for low-shot transfer under style shifts.
