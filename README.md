# Causal Motion Forecasting

This is an official implementation for **Towards Robust and Adaptive Motion Forecasting: A Causal Representation Perspective**

TL;DR: incorporate causal invariance and structure into motion representation learning to promote the robustness and transferability of trajectory forecasting models under common types of distributional shifts.

Code will be fully released by Januray 2022.
